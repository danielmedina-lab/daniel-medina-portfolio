## Public Asset Routes

CV PDFs are served from `public/cv/`:

```txt
/cv/daniel-medina-sanchez-cv-es.pdf
/cv/daniel-medina-sanchez-cv-en.pdf
```

The legacy `/cv/daniel-medina-sanchez-cv-en-no-photo.pdf` route remains as an
exact compatibility copy of the canonical English CV. It is not presented as a
separate public option.

The Figma Tier-S prototype source is retained as build reference only:

```txt
figma-source/Tier-S.zip
```

Handoff and boundary documents remain in `docs/` and are not exposed as public UI content.

## Public Content Boundary

The public website must not expose:

- private TransformIA source code;
- customer data;
- API keys, credentials or secrets;
- private emails or internal documents;
- legal or litigation-sensitive material;
- full CS50 assessment solutions;
- unsupported ROI or compliance certification claims;
- autonomous recruitment, email or calendar actions.

## Next Steps

1. Add a production `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` value in Vercel.
2. Add a real OpenGraph image under `public/og/` and reference it in metadata.
3. Run a browser/Lighthouse QA pass after deployment.
4. Decide whether to add an optional contact API route or keep contact as mail/LinkedIn only.
